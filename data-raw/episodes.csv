Tony Gebely, author of ""The Philosophy of Tea: A User's Guide"" has some of his own theories - theories which lead the creator of America's premiere electric kettle brand, Fellow. Jake Miller prefers his boiling water on coffee, not tea - and he argues (somewhat in jest) that the electric kettle could have a massive impact on America's GDP."
